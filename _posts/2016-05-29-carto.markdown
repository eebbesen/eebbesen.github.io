[CartoDB][carto-home] is one of several free sites where you can upload, visualize and share data using maps.  Let's create a [CartoDB][carto-home] account and upload a dataset.

### Sign up for a [CartoDB][carto-home] account
Create an account using an existing email address or Google account [here][carto-signup].  

### Upload a dataset
You probably already have data that you're interested in.  If not, you can browse the [CartoDB data library][carto-datasets] (look for 'Data library') or [Data.gov][data-gov].  If you cannot think of anything that interests you, you can use the [Ramsey County census block shape files][ramsey-co-census-blocks].

* Download a dataset that interests you
* Click the New Dataset button on the [CartoDB datasets page][carto-datasets]
* Drag your csv, zip or other data file into the upload area and wait as the data is uploaded and processed.  This can take several minutes so be patient.
* Click Map View to see your data visualized on a map


### Having trouble visualizing your dataset?
It is possible your data is not in a format [CartoDB][carto-home] can understand.  This is typically the case if your dataset does not have data in the column named `the_geom` and/or does not include clearly defined latitude and longitude columns.

### Next
Future posts will cover conversion strategies for making your data compatible with CartoDB.

[CartoDB][carto-home] is one of several free sites where you can upload, visualize and share data using maps.  Let's create a [CartoDB][carto-home] account and upload a dataset.

### Sign up for a [CartoDB][carto-home] account
Create an account using an existing email address or Google account [here][carto-signup].  

### Upload a dataset
You probably already have data that you're interested in.  If not, you can browse the [CartoDB data library][carto-datasets] (look for 'Data library') or [Data.gov][data-gov].  If you cannot think of anything that interests you, use the [Metro Transit Go To card retailers][go-to-retailers] dataset.

### Upload a dataset
* Click the New Dataset button on the [CartoDB datasets page][carto-datasets]
* Drag your csv, zip or other data file into the upload area and wait as the data is uploaded and processed.  This can take several minutes so be patient.
* Click Map View to see your data visualized on a map

The Data View will display your data similar to a spreadsheet.  If [CartoDB][carto-home] understands where the location data for your dataset is the second column (named `the_geom`) will display something besides `null`.  If you click Map View you will see your data plotted on the map!

### Having trouble visualizing your dataset?
If `the_geom` is `null` your data is not in a format [CartoDB][carto-home] can automatically understand.  Clicking Map View will show you a map with no data points.  This is typically the case if your dataset does not have data in the column named `the_geom` and/or does not include clearly defined latitude and longitude columns.

In many cases you can help CartoDB understand the location data in your dataset by telling it which columns hold location information.

Future posts will cover georeferencing and conversion strategies for making your data compatible with CartoDB.

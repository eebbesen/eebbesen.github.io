Eric has been writing code since 1999.  Most of this code has been JUnit-covered Java but now tends to be Minitest- and RSpec-covered Ruby and Rails.  He is trying hard to improve his UI chops, but has a fair way to go.

In his spare time Eric uses technology as best he can to make communities fairer, safer and more efficient.
